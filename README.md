# Mock_Zoo_Database

This was a school assignment to practice using SQL.  A zoo database was created of animals in an imaginary collection, with their assigned habitat locations and current diet plans.  The assignment mentioned that some of the animals should be aquatic and some terrestrial.  The assignment also called for each animal's phylum, taxonomic class, special care instructions, and curator to be listed, as well as whether each animal was a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore.

A few different queries, try/catch blocks, and procedure creations were performed.
